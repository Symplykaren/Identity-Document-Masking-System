# AI_Project_Application
Project details:
1.	Develop a Korean ID card information masking application to mask the face, name, address, and registration number sections of the ID cards
2.	On the interface, the user should have the opportunity to decide if they want to mask only the face region of the ID card or choose to mask the text region of the ID card (name, address, registration number). These text regions will be masked simultaneously (I didn’t separate them).

## Application interface
1.	Screen 1 is the home screen of the application where the user is given the opportunity to either directly take a picture from the application, or choose an image of the ID card from the phone gallery
2.	Screen one opens to screens 2a and 2b.
3.	After taking a picture or selecting from the gallery, the picture is then sent to screen 3 where the “text masking” and “face masking” scripts will be triggered after the user clicks any of the buttons
4.	When the user clicks any of the buttons, the mask will be applied to the image, and then the user will save it to their phone.
